\subsubsection*{Question 1}
The addition uses the keyword add, the addition can be performed on the differents variables sizes, if the result is too big for the variable, then the carry bit is set to 1.\\
The multiplication uses the keyword mul, it can multiply numbers up to 16 bits, the resulting MSB is write on WREG1, the LSB is on the WREG0

\subsubsection*{Question 2}
c=a+b OK; g=a+b OK; g=e+f OK; g=e-f is a positive number but should be negative, it should use signed variable; g=f+g is too big, it checks the carry bit to verify if there is an overflow, and then set the variable to the maximal value; s3=s1+s2 is negative but should be positive, the numbers are too big then it is detected and it sets the value to its max; s3=s1+s2 it is the same problem than before but too small value so it is set to its min; c=a*b too big, set to 0; g=a*b OK; g=e*f too big; h=e*f too big because variable size too smal, h=e*f OK; j=h*i wrong withtout cast, correct with.

\subsubsection*{Question 3}
INT8 = INT8*INT8 : wrong, 13 cycles; 
INT16 = INT8*INT8 : correct, 11 cycles; 
INT16 = INT16*INT16 : wrong, 5 cycles; 
INT32 = INT16*INT16 : wrong, 7 cycles; 
INT32 = INT32*INT32 : correct, 16 cycles; 
INT64 = INT32*INT32 : wrong, 31 cycles; 
INT64 = INT64*INT64 : correct, 110 cycles; 
The casts take time, the closer the size of the variable to 16, the lower the number of cycle

\subsubsection*{Question 4}
d=(a*b)/c multiplication is too big so the result is wrong; 
d=(a/c)*b the division is ok but the final result is too big; 
f=a*b/c multiplication first, enough room so the result is ok; 
f=(a*b)/c same as above; 
f=(a/c)*b division first, the result is different because there is a loss of precision with the division, it is better to do it later; 
f=a*(b/c) the division is smaller so there is more loss of precision therefore the reuslt is different and worse; 
f=(a*b)/c and 
d=(a/c)*b both result gives the same number but the second calcul is not safe, here the result on d is correct because a/c can hold on 8 bit.
    
\subsubsection*{Question 5}
The difference is the order of the operations and the size of the variable, the multiplication should be done first because in an integer division, the larger the number to divided, the higher the precision. Moreover, the multiplication never adds errors but the division does so it is better to do the operation with errors last in order the avoid the propagation of them.

\subsubsection*{Question 6}
The division is way longer, it takes 13 cycle to perfom multiplication and 32 to do the division (with INT8U).

\subsubsection*{Question 7}
classical method: result = 57, 266 cycles; 
2nd method: result = 56, 25 cycles; 
3rd method: result = 57, 26 cycles

\subsubsection*{Question 8}
The two operands were first multiplied by 16, then multiplied between themselves and then the result must be divided by 2\^8, it is done with the shift. The +128 is used to round the value, if the 7th lsb is set to 1, then it means that the floating part of the number is greater or equal to 1/2, then by adding 128 to the value we conserve that information. Imagine we have a=b*c, what is done here is a = ((b*16)*(c*16))/256 = b*16*c*16/256 = b*c*256/256

\subsubsection*{Question 9}
It lose all the non int information, therefore having a precision of one unity where the 3rd method has precision of half a unit.

\subsubsection*{Question 10}
The last division should be $2^{(4+6)}$, the computation time is the same.

\subsubsection*{Question 11}
These variables are stored in the stack.

\subsubsection*{Question 12}
The parameters of these functions are placed in registers before calling the function. The value of the first parameter is stored in W0, the value of the second one is stored in W1, and so on.

\subsubsection*{Question 13}
The local variable "a" is stored in the stack, at the first address of the stack.

\subsubsection*{Question 14}
In Add3, the parameters are stored in the stack at addresses higher than those of the local variables.

\subsubsection*{Question 15}
The return value of Add3 and Mul2 are placed in W0.

\subsubsection*{Question 16}
This parameter is passed by reference. This means that the address (the address of the first element of the array in this case) where this parameter is stored is given to the function (the address is stored in a register, here, W2).

\subsubsection*{Question 17}
The address of the first element of the array received as parameter is stored in the stack like any other parameter. In order to access an element of an array, the address of the element is computed (using the base address of the array given by parameter and the offset given in the code) and stored in a working register. Then, the element is accessed using indirect addressing mode with the working register containing the address of this element.

\subsubsection*{Question 18}
\&a means the address where the variable a is stored. *a means the value stored at address stored in a.

\subsubsection*{Question 19}
Two addresses are given to the swapnum function which realizes a swap between two variables. This function exchange the values stored at addresses contained in pointers i and j. A temporary variable is needed because once we replace the first value by the second one we have to save this erased in order to replace the second value by the first one.

\subsubsection*{Question 20}
This area (program memory) is seen as a continuation of the data memory from the program point of view. This works like that because we want to use the same instructions for accessing the program memory and the data memory. The a variable is stored at address 0x829e which is a location of the program memory.

\subsubsection*{Question 21}
When we use a INTU8 index, this index has to be prefixed with zeroes before using it for indirect addressing mode. This is done to fit a 16 bits register which is not the case with a INTU16 index.
